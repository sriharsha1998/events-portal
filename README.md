# events-portal
A website where users are required to first register on the website and then the users are taken to the login page and then they are given an option to add a new event there.
In the add new event page the details of the event like Event name, Event location, Event description, Event start date and event end date and also an image for the event hase to be added in order to add the event to the events database.

After adding all these details then the Add event button should be pressed so that a new event shall be added to the events database.

After adding a new event then the user is directly taken to the list of events page where all the present events are displayed along with the event details like event name, event description, event location, start and end dates and an image to the side of the event will be displayed.

This is a small website which is similiar to the many websites where we can post events for the public to know about those events and can come to attend those events.

I have developed this website as an assignment given to me when I applied for an internship/job opportunities at various companies. 

I had developed this website in mainly 3 parts.

First I had developed the registration and login flow for users to register and login into the website.

Then I developed how users can add event details to the website and add images for events.

Later, I developed pages where the current events can be displayed to users when they logged into the website and also after adding a new event, users are re-directed to the events page.
